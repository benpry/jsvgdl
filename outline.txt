Getting vgdl online

The Server
	- Currently, I can get gamejs games running through a simple python server
	- Just need to rewrite the core so that it can work like this

Rewriting core.py and ontology.py, also tools.py (used by core.)

	core.py
		Contains game information, so needs to be rewritten to match how gamejs initiates games

	ontology.py
		should be trivial. 

	tools.py
		Similarly so, except that it uses pygame

Easiest thing to delegate:
	
	Someone has to rewrite the ontology.

Okay, so this is going to depend on the server alot more then I want it to
